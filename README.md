# InventoryValidator
Validate files within a folder on G Suite 

This project was created to spec-out a Google Apps Script which can check files within a G Suite folder to ensure they are:

* Well-formed
* Pass basic validation

Sample test files are hosted on the G Suite Drive folder called ['ValidateInventories-UpworkJob-2018-04-23'](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k6rZYbuUIHsPboeH5CKo4CT1L1qxthV1) of a test Google Account. 

`features` directory contains \*.feature files which outline some of the expected behaviours in [Gherkin](http://behat.org/en/latest/user_guide/gherkin.html) syntax. (I have just started to read about [Behat](http://behat.org/en/latest/) and hence giving BDD a crack).
